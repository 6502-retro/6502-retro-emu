# 6502 Retro! Emulator

## About This Emulator

This is a functional emulator.  It's about the simplest type possible.  In
otherwords, this is not a cycle accurate emulator.  It's just enough emulation
to test the filesystem and console (UART) features of the 6502-Retro!.

And by UART, I really just mean the basic input and output.  No flow control or
any other hardware specific features.  To be fair, I never got flow control
working anyway.

## Usage

```text
emu [<flags>] [command] [args]:
  -h             this help
  -d             enter debugger on startup
  -t             enable instruction tracing on startup
If command is specified, a Unix file of that name will be loaded and
injected directly into memory (it's not loaded through the CCP).
The first two arguments are mapped to the standard FCBs.

CTRL+C will usually issue a CTRL+C to the program.
CTRL+X will exit to the debugger.
```

There is a `make_sdcard.sh` script in the
[6502-retro-os](https://github.com/6502-retro/6502-retro-os.git) project that
will create an sdcard image with the default apps on drive A:

## Development

Because this emulator emulates the BIOS only, there will have to be some kind of
OS on the sdcard image to work with.  So there are two main choices:

1. put the code you're developping into sectors 1 to 16 (inclusive) of the
   sdcard image.  This is where the OS is copied to by the `make_sdcard.sh` script
   above. This is what you should do if you're writing a new OS.  The emulator
   automatically jumps to the address at FFFC.
   1. This is not actually true right now.  It should, but the 6502-Retro-Os has
      sdcard initialization which hangs in the emulator.  A magic number is used
      as the start address for now.  I am thinking of approaches to override
      this address.  Perhaps with a commandline option.
2. use the `py_sfs_v2/cli.py` script to copy your compiled `.com` files into one
   of the 8 drives on the sdcard image.  Then boot the emulator.

_note: there is some work to be done on the `py_sfs_v2/cli.py` script to support
overwriting files copied to the sdcard image.  I think the intention was that it
should be doing this, but in latest testing, it does not.  So I think that's a
bug.  For now, just `era your.com` file inside the OS within the emulator._

## Running

Simply run the emulator and path to this image to get started.

```text
./emu ../6502-retro-os/py_sfs_v2/6502-retro-sdcard.img
```

## Debugging

Press `CTRL+X` to enter the debugger.

```text
A>PC=020C SP=01FC A=80 X=03 Y=01 P=01 -------C
020c : 4c 34 ee : jmp EE34

  r               show registers
  r <reg> <value> set register
  b               show breakpoints
  b <addr>        set breakpoint
  db <addr>       delete breakpoint
  w <addr>        set watchpoint
  dw <addr>       delete watchpoint
  m <addr> <len>  show memory
  u <addr> <len>  unassemble memory
  s               single step
  g               continue
  q               quit
  trace 0|1       enable tracing
```

If your code has a `brk` statement in it, then the debugger will automatically
enter debug mode at that address.
