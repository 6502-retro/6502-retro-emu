# 6502 Retro! Emulator

## About This Emulator

This is a functional emulator.  It's about the simplest type possible.  In
otherwords, this is not a cycle accurate emulator.  It's just enough emulation
to test the filesystem and console (UART) features of the 6502-Retro!.

And by UART, I really just mean the basic input and output.  No flow control or
any other hardware specific features.  To be fair, I never got flow control
working anyway.

## Usage

```text
emu [<flags>] [command] [args]:
  -h             this help
  -d             enter debugger on startup
  -t             enable instruction tracing on startup
If command is specified, a Unix file of that name will be loaded and
injected directly into memory (it's not loaded through the CCP).
The first two arguments are mapped to the standard FCBs.

CTRL+C will usually issue a CTRL+C to the program.
CTRL+X will exit to the debugger.
```

There is a `make_sdcard.sh` script in the
[6502-retro-os](https://github.com/6502-retro/6502-retro-os.git) project that
will create an SDCARD image with the default apps on drive A:

Simply run the emulator and path to this image to get started.

```text
./emu ../6502-retro-os/py_sfs_v2/6502-retro-sdcard.img
```

## Debugging

Press `CTRL+X` to enter the debugger.
